			<p>   Currently, I'm a research engineer in the Complex Systems Group at the<a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/ngg/" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>University of Pennsylvania</b></a>, working with <a href="https://complexsystemsupenn.com" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Danielle Bassett</b></a>. I got my PhD in neuroscience from Penn working with Prof. Danielle Bassett and <a href="http://cnt.upenn.edu/research/lucas-lab" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Timothy Lucas</b></a> in 2021, and I graduated the University of California Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Cognitive Science in 2016. At Berkeley, I worked in the lab of <a href="https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Prof. Robert Knight</b></a>.</p>

			<p>   In my PhD, I studied network models of perturbations to neural dynamics. I found combining computational modeling with time-resolved neural recordings (usually intracranial EEG) to be an especially useful, interesting, and fun way to investigate these topics. My research now extends to network models of human learning and interaction. As a research engineer, I also spend a lot my time doing software engineering tasks for the Complex Systems Group to help other people's research go smoothly.</p>

			<p>	 Check out Penn's <a href="https://medium.com/penn-engineering/penn-researchers-model-optimizes-brain-stimulation-therapies-improving-memory-in-tests-f3ed517ec7cc" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>press release</b></a> about my first project modeling direct electrical brian stimulation. </p>
			<p> In the summer of 2019, I developed content for and taught a Python Bootcamp at Penn. You can find an article about the bootcamp <a href="https://omnia.sas.upenn.edu/story/driven-data" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a></p>

			<p><a href="os_talk.pdf" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>Resources for anyone (and everyone) to help make their science more open. </b></a> I spoke at the Penn Libraries' <b>#openscience</b> week about resources for open science. The talk itself focuses on open science practices with minimal downsides (reporting clarity, preprints, outreach, statistics) but include more extensive resources on preregistration and code sharing at the end.

			<p> I have also given talks at BRAIN Investigators meeting 2020, WiDS 2020, NetSci 2018, SfN 2018, AES 2018, and the Penn Topology in Biology Symposium 2018.

			<h3>Outreach</h3>
			<p>	  I am always looking for opportunities to get people excited about science. In addition to my research, I write for science blogs and outreach journals, teach and design content for coding bootcamps, and am actively involved in neuroscience outreach at Penn through <a href="https://www.upennglia.com/" class="ext" target="_blank"><b>GLIA.</b></a> </p>

			<p> <a href="ffym.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank"><b>How do we understand other people?</b></a> <em> Frontiers for Young Minds</em>, (2016). Imagine this: you walk into class and see your friend sitting alone at a table. You notice your friend is looking downward, with a frown on her face. You would probably think from these clues that your friend is sad. But how did you know that? One way that your brain accomplishes this is by simulating or copying in your mind what you see the other person doing. This may help you understand that when you are frowning and looking downward, you are usually sad, so it is probably the case that your friend is sad too. While there are other hypotheses for how our brain understands others, we are going to focus on simulation. We will first examine neuroimaging experiments, in monkeys and in humans, in which we use technology to get an indication of brain activity. These brain activations help us understand simulation better. Lastly, we will discuss disorders such as autism, in which it may be more difficult to understand othersâ€™ actions, intentions, and emotions.
