      <h2>Double/debiased machine learning</h2>
      <h5>Light- to medium-math exaplaination of the method with tutorials, June 10, 2021</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>

        <h3>What is double machine learning</h3>
        Double machine learning is actually a way to esetimate causal effects in large, complex data that have a specific causal structure. Previously many causal 
        modeling methods relied on assuming a specific form of the data rather than learning it, and didn't allow with data with (DEFINITION OF COMPLEXITY), making them less useful in
         many modern data settings. DML allows these two to coexist, which is the source of much of the hype in economics. 
        
        <h4>the problem</h4>
        Similarly, clinical machine learning projects have made a major push towards building risk or diagnostic models. Less attention has been devoted to using
        learning to suggest treatments or interventions. I think it's worth testing to waters to see if this can be done responsibly. DML presents one path forward. 
        I had mentioned previously that DML assumes a particular causal structure in your data. We can illustrate that struvture like this:
        
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>
        
        Here, Y is some clinical outcome of interest (risk of disease, probability of diagnosis, etc.). T is some treatment or intervention. X is all the
         demographic, medical features of the patients. This diagram is illustrating that the treatment will influence the risk of disease, and that features of the
         patient will influence both the risk and which/whether treatments will be given. Broadly, the goal is to estimate the size of the arrow connecting T and Y
          (referred to now as the treatment effect). Specifically, we want that estimation to:
        <ol>
              <li> be accurate with a lot of data (might seem obvious, but this is harder than it sounds)</li>
              <li>come with confidence intervals</li>
              <li> not make strict assumptions about the form of the data (leverage machine learning)</li>
        </ol>
         
        
        <h4>DML's solution</h4>
        These points have historically been hard to acheive because methods for 'good' causal estimates typically do not give us point 3, and methods of machine
         learning typically do not give us point 1 (and sometimes 2). Machine learning models do not give good causal estimates for 2 reasons:
         <ol>
            <li>Regularization, necessary for fitting complex data, induces a bias. To reduce overfitting, analysts using machine learning methods often use 
                regularization. If you're familiar with LASSO or RIDGE regression, this is a classic example of using regularization. However, this necessarily 
                increases the bias of estimates.</li>
            <li>Despite our best efforts, machine learning tends to overfit data, further biasing results.
                DML can remove those two sources of bias and give us an estimate of the treatment effect and all of the extra points outlined above. At a high level, 
                these biases are alleviated by fitting two separate machine learning models (thus the name) to estimate the effect of X on Y and T, and then solving for
                theta using the residuals of those estimates (more details on this below). Additionally, there are now some pretty good packages implementing DML 
                in python that play nicely with scikit learn. All together making it a desireable new method for applied scientists, and motivating me to give it a try. </li>
         </ol>
        
        <h4>caveats and alternatives</h4>
        Like all methods, DML comes with important assumptions and caveats. 
        Assumptions (most of these are true of many causal methods):
        <ol>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li>You are recording all variables that influence Y and T in X. I think this is the most fraught assumption in medical contexts (REF).</li>
        </ol>

        Caveats:
        <ol>
            <li>categorical treatment</li>
            <li> biased data classes</li>
        </ol>
        
        Alternatives
        <ol>
            <li> doubly robust learning</li>
            <li>TLME</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>How DML allows causal inference and machine learning to mix </h3>
        We're now going to describe the method in more detail than the above summary. The goal here is to hit the major points of the DML paper (REF) restructured
        for a more applied audience. I found these points difficult to work through on my own (thus the blog post). However if you're satisfied with the above description,
        skip to the code example.
        
        <h4>direct method</h4>
        To formalize the problems and solutions discussed above, we're going to have to be more mathematically precise with our definitions. We're going to start by
        defining a specific formula for generating data. 
        
        $$ {Y = T\theta_{0} + g_{0}(X) + U, E[U | X,T] = 0]} $$
        $$ {T = m_{0}(X) + V, E[V | X] = 0} $$
        
        Let's walk through the terms:
        <ul>
            <li>X the features</li>
            <li> Y the outcome</li>
            <li>T the treatment (it can be binary, continuous, or categorical)</li>
            <li> g(x) some mappong of x to y</li>
            <li> m(x) some mapping of x to t</li>
            <li> theta - the treatment effect</li>
            <li> the noise, which cancels out on average</li>
        </ul>
        
        This equation is essentially formalizing the graph we had displayed earlier.
        
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>
        
        These equations are a useful example because they give us a specific functional form for how T affects Y (T times theta). Since this relationship is linear,
        it makes some of the math a little bit nicer. In the end, we want DML to work for more than just this specific situation, but this definition is useful for now. 
        If we were to code up these relationships in python, it would look something like this
        
        <pre><code class="python"> DGP code </code>></pre>
        
        Let's imaging you haven't read this blog post and you given some X,T, and Y data. You're told that there is definitely a linear relationship between T and
        Y. You're then asked to estimate what that relationship is exactly. They tell you they know the answer, but want to see if you can find it on your own. 
        If you're like me, your first instinct might be to estimate theta exactly. Specifically, you could use your machine learning model of choice 
        (for me, random forest) to estimate Y from X, then regress out the effect of T. 
        
        Mathematically, you can do this by moving some terms around to isolate theta
        
        $$ EQUATION $$
        
        In code, the direct method would look like this.
        
        <pre><code class="python"> DM code </code>></pre>
        
        Now we can see how well we did! If our estimate is good, we would expect the normalized difference between our estimate of theta, and the real theta to
         be centered on 0.
         
         <div class="fakeimg">Image of histogram</div>
        
        This histogram shows that is not the case. Our estimate is centered on a slightly positive value. What went wrong?
        
        At a high level, what went wrong is that we did not explicitly model the effect of X on T. That influence is biasing our estimate in a few ways. 
        Illustrating this explicitly is where our partially linear data generating process comes in handy. We can write out an equation for the error in our estimate.
         As a reminder, the goal here would be for this term to converge to 0 as we get more data.

         <h4>regularization bias</h4>
        
        $$ \sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta_0} - \theta_0) = (\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in I}^nT_{i}^2)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^nT_{i}U_{i} + (\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in I}^nT_{i}^2)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^nT_{i}(g_0(X_i) - \hat{g_0}(X_i))$$
        
        <ul>
            <li>LHS</li>
            <li>Noise cancels out on average, so this term is a very small number, divided by a big number. Essentially 0</li>
            <li>This term is where the problem is. Our estimate error is never going to be 0, and won;t quite be cenmtered on 0. This because of the deal we make as 
                data scientists working with complex data. Reduce the varaince (overfitting) of our machine learning model, we induce some bias in our estimate (often through 
                regularization). Additionally, T depends on X, and therefore also will not converge to 0. Because of this, g-g_hat times T will be small, but not zero. 
                It will be divided by a large number, and will converge to 0 eventually, but too slowly to be practical. </li>
        </ul>
        
        We have to remove theeffect of X on T to circumvent this bias. We can do this in three steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Estimate T from X using ML model of choice (different from the direct method!)</li>
            <li> Estimate Y from X using ML model of choice</li>
            <li> Regress the residuals of each model onto eachother to get theta</li>
        </ol>

        We can write out a new error equation like so:
        
        $$ { \sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta_0} - \theta_0) = (EV^2)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^nU_iV_i + (EV^2)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^n(\hat{m_0}(X_i) - m_0(X_i))(\hat{g_0}(X_i) - g_0(X_i)) + ... } $$
       
        <ul>
            <li>LHS</li>
            <li>Noise cancels out on average, so this term is a very small number, divided by a big number. Essentially 0</li>
            <li>Now we have two small, non-0 numbers multiplied by eachother, divided by a large number. This will converge to 0 much more quickly than before </li>
            <li> ... this method adds a new term that we're going to ignore for now. But it comes back later!</li>
        </ul>
        
        For this specific data generating process, we now have a way of estimating theta without regularization bias! However I mentioned earlier that we want to be 
        able to estimate more than only this process. In particular, step three involves linear regression, and only works in our partially linear example. How do
         we generalize the method of estimating theta?
         
         The least squares solution for linear relationships esentially finds the parameters for a line that minimizes the error between the predicted points on 
         the line, and the observed data. We can wrote this as the minimization of a cost function of our data and true parameters
         
         $$ \psi(W; \theta, \eta) = 0 $$
         
         This equation looks vary different but contains a lot of the same players as before:

         <ol>
             <li>W is the data (X,Y, and T)</li>
             <li>Theta is the true treatment effect</li>
             <li> psi is just some cost function. We are purposely not defining it because we want this to be a general solution, but you can think of it as any kind of 
                error minimization function</li>
             <li> eta is called the nuissance parameter, and here contains g and m</li>
         </ol>

         Solving minimization problems like these are often difficult and subject to noise. To assure we find a robust solution, we're going to add one other condition
          to our equation (called a moment condition)
          
        $$ { \delta_{\eta}E[\psi(W; \theta, \eta][\eta - \eta_0] = 0} $$
         
         Technically, this is a direction al Gateaux derivative. Practically, what this means is that we expect that the true value of theta would be robust to 
         small purturbations in the nuissance parameters. This has the benefit of giving use estimates that will be stable in the presence of small changes to our
         ML models.
         
         There are whole branches of mathematics dedidated to solving these tpyes of equations with moment conditions, and there is no single good solution. All the 
         different solutions are called 'DML estimators'. Rather than getting into any specific estimator here, we're just going to trust that they exist, and move on.
         We'll talk a little bit about a specific estimator in the code section.
         
         We now have a more generalizable set of steps
         <ol>
             <li> Estimate T from X</li>
             <li> Estimate Y from X</li>
             <li> Solve moment equation to get theta</li>
         </ol>
        
         <h4>overfitting bias</h4>
        We now have a generalizable solution to regulatization bias. Additionally, with the definition of a cost function, we have a method of evaluating our DML
         estimator and comparing different models. Specifically, we can find the model that gives smallest value for our moment condition. The specific value of
         this function is usually called a 'score' or 'Neyman orthogonality score', and the closer to 0 it is the better. We will use this value to perform model 
        selection in the example later.
        
        But first, it's time to revisit out error equation in the partially linear case.
        
        $$ { \sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta_0} - \theta_0) = (EV^2)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^nU_iV_i + (EV^2)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^n(\hat{m_0}(X_i) - m_0(X_i))(\hat{g_0}(X_i) - g_0(X_i)) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i \in I}^{n}V_i(\hat{g_0}(X_i) - g_0(X_i)) } $$
        
        We've discussed the first terms perviously, but I'm revealing the last term we had hidden previously.
        * If any overfitting is present in g_hat, the estimate will pick up some noise from the noise term. This will slow down the convergence of this new term to 0
        
        The solution to this bias is to fit g and m on a different set of data than the set used to estimate theta. Similar to how cross-validation avoids overfitting 
        during parameter selection, this method (called cross-fitting) avoids overfitting in out estimation of theta. This changes our DML steps slightly.
        
        <ol>
            <li>Split the data into K folds. For each fold:</li>
            <li> Estimate T from X using ML model of choice and fold K</li>
            <li> Estimate Y from X using ML model of choice and fold K</li>
            <li> Solve moment equation get theta using other sets of data</li>
            <li>Select theta estimate that gives the best solution over all splits.</li>
        </ol>

        Using this process, we can correct the bias in our stimateion

        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>
        
        This is the DML method! Now I'll show you how to apply it.
         
        <h3>Example, with code</h3>
        We're now going to walk through an example application of DML to a simulated medical dataset. If you didn't read the above section, it will be usefull to check in with the steps listed above. For simplicity, we're going to use the same data generating process we discuessed above
        
        $$ {Y = T\theta_{0} + g_{0}(X) + U, E[U | X,T] = 0]} $$
        $$ {T = m_{0}(X) + V, E[V | X] = 0} $$
        
        As a reminder, X are our patient features, Y is a binary predictor of outcome or risk, and T is a binary indicator of treatment. Theta is the treatment effect, the term we're interested in. We can simulate this data in python using the same code as before. As a reminder:
        
        <pre><code class="python"> simulating data code </code>></pre>
        
        We're also going to split our data into folds for evaluation. It's important to remember that each training fold is going to be further split within the DML estimator, so we want to make sure there are enough observations in the fold to split further.
        
        <pre><code class="python"> data splitting code </code>></pre>
        
        The econML package has different 'estimator' functions that all take data, a Y model, and a T model as input. Therefore, we're going to start with step 2 listed above: estimating T (we'll do the data splitting process later). You can really do this however you want, we're just going to define a simple random forest model here. econML has the benefit of working with GridSearchCV object as well, so we're actually going to define not one speciifc model, but a set models with different parameterizations (if you aren't familiar with GridSearchCV, check out its docs).
        
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        # parameters for forest
        params = {
            'max_depth': [5, 10],
            'min_samples_leaf': [2, 4],
            'min_samples_split': [2, 4],
            'class_weight': ['balanced', None],
            'n_estimators':[400, 1000]
            }
        
        t_mdls = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(),
                                params,
                                cv=nFold,
                                verbose=1,
                                scoring='f1_macro')
        t_mdl = t_mdls.fit(X_train, np.ravel(y_train)).best_estimator_ 
        </code>></pre>

        You can evaluate these models any way you want to. We'll use ROC
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        plt.figure()

        pred = t_mdl.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
            
        fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test,pred,drop_intermediate=False)
        roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test,pred)

        plt.plot(fpr, tpr,
                lw=lw, label='Risk: %0.2f' % roc_auc)
        plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='k', lw=2, linestyle='--')
        plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
        plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
        plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
        plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
        plt.title('Outcome ROC Curves')
        plt.legend(loc="best")
        plt.show() 
        </code>></pre>
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>

        We can do exactly the same thing for the Y model. Let's use a gradient boosted classifier to mix things up.
        
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        # parameters for XGB
        params = {
            'max_depth': range (2, 10, 1),
            'n_estimators': range(60, 220, 40),
            'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.01, 0.05]
            }
        y_mdls = GridSearchCV(XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False,eval_metric='logloss', n_jobs=1),
                                params,cv=nFold,n_jobs=nJobs,verbose=1,scoring = 'f1_macro')
        
        y_mdl = y_mdls.fit(X_train_clean, np.ravel(y_train)).best_estimator_
        </code>></pre>

        <pre><code class="python"> 
        plt.figure()

        pred = y_mdl.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
            
        fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test,pred,drop_intermediate=False)
        roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test,pred)

        plt.plot(fpr, tpr,
                lw=lw, label='Risk: %0.2f' % roc_auc)
        plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='k', lw=2, linestyle='--')
        plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
        plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
        plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
        plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
        plt.title('Outcome ROC Curves')
        plt.legend(loc="best")
        plt.show() 
        </code>></pre>
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>
        
        We can now pick an estimator. econML has 3 main estimators that provide confidence intervals. SparseLinear and Linear estimator will only work if you have many more observations than variables (see this link for comparisons of different estimators). For my data, this was not the case, so left me with 1 option: CausalForest estimator (REF). Like random forest models, this estimator also has the benefit of being able to estimate non-linear treatment effects in a piece-wise fashion.
        
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        est = CausalForestDML(model_y=y_mdl, model_t=t_mdl, discrete_treatment=True, cv=3)
        est.fit(Y=y_train, T=T_train, X=X_train) 
        </code>></pre>
        
        This function takes care of the cross-fitting procedure! The argument XX defines how many folds to use for cross fitting. The default is 3, but the original paper recommends using 5 or 6 if possible.
        
        Also similar to RandomForestCLassifiers in scikit learn, the CausalForest estimator has many other parameters. If you're familiar with random forests many of these parameters will be familiar: the number of trees to include, the maximum depth of those trees, etc. The big exception in parameters between causal forests in econML and sklearn is that econML forest has no class weightnig option (XXX). This is because the causal forest method makes use of a specific weighting strategy already (REF). 
        
        Additionally, the econML estimator does not take the 'params' argument, and therefore can't be used as input into sklearns Grid or RandomSearchCV functions. However we can do our own hyperparameter selection by comparing the 'score' between different parameter choices and selecting the lowest one. For brevity, we're going to use a random sampling strategy for hyperparameter selection. This means that rather than trying every possible parameter combination, we're going to randomly select some and pick the best option, assuming that we will get similar performance in the long run

        Now that we how our cross validation and parameters set up, we can find the best parameters
        
        <pre><code class="python">

                            n_estimators=n)

        # stratified cv
        for train_index, test_index in skf.split(x, y):
            X_htrain, X_htest = x[train_index], x[test_index]
            y_htrain, y_htest = y[train_index], y[test_index]
            T_htrain, T_htest = t[train_index], t[test_index]

            est.fit(Y=np.ravel(y_htrain), T=T_htrain, X=X_htrain)
            scores.append(est.score(y_htest, T_htest, X=X_htest))

            curr_dict = {'depth': [d],
                        'min_leaf': [l],
                        'min_split': [s],

                        'score': [np.mean(scores)],
                        'score_sc': [np.std(scores)],
                        'med': [med]}
            no_score = pd.concat([hp_score, curr_dict])

        # pick the best parameters, and fit the model
        best_n = no_score.loc[no_score['score'] == no_score['score'].min(), 'n'].values[0]
        best_d = no_score.loc[no_score['score'] == no_score['score'].min(), 'depth'].values[0]

                                    discrete_treatment=True, verbose=0, cv=3,

        The 'score' function (if you use the default option) tells you the value of the cost function defining Neyman orthogonality. Its essentially telling you how close you were to finding a theta value that minimizes error/maximizes liklihood, and it stable for perturbations to your two machine learning models. Satisfying these two conditions assures an unbiased estimate of theta. While this number is a bit harder to interpret than MSE you might be used to, for the purpose of model or parameter selection it is satisfactory to select the model that gives the lowest score.
        
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        # print scores for each medicine
        hp_score['param_set'] = ["_".join(x) for x in hp_score[['n', 'depth', 'min_leaf', 'min_split']].astype(str).values]
        sns.stripplot(data=hp_score,  y="score", hue="param_set", size=10)
        plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.04,1), loc="upper left")
        </code>></pre>
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>
        
        We can now fit the model using the parameters that gave the lowest score
        
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        xxx    
        </code>></pre>
        
        We can now look at the distribution for of CATE's for all individuals in the test set.
        
        <pre><code class="python"> 
        # plot
        n_bins = 10
        effect = est.effect(X=X_test_clean)
        plt.hist(effect, bins = n_bins, label=med,alpha=.8, color=colors[med_idx])
        plt.title('Effect Values')
        plt.xlabel('Effect')
        plt.ylabel('Count')    
        </code>></pre>
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>

        We can also look at the CI for a single individual.

        <pre><code class="python"> 
        # get individual CATES
        patient_idx = np.random.randint(np.shape(X_test)[0])
                
        # get cate
        cate = mdl.effect(X_test[patient_idx:patient_idx+1,])[0]
        
        # get cate CI
        lb, ub = mdl_dict[name].effect_interval(X_test_clean[patient_idx:patient_idx+1,], alpha=0.05)
        
        # plot CATEs with CI for individual patients
        plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
        plt.errorbar(1, cate, yerr=ci, 
                        fmt="o", ecolor='k', zorder=1)
        plt.tight_layout()
        </code>></pre>
        <div class="fakeimg">Image of graph</div>

        How'd we do? Since this is simulated data, we can see how well our estimated treament matches

        <pre><code class="python"> 
        # plot   
        </code>></pre>

        We did pretty well! As expected, given the simulated data. This concludes the extent of the code walkthrough. If you're still looking for more, check out the other resources I found useful below.
