			<p><a href="graph_learning.pdf" class="paperimg" target="_blank"><img src="task.png" width = "300px" align = 'center' alt="A schematic of a model of sequence learning. Sequences can be generated from a latent space of items, and potential transitions between them. For people experiencing these sequences, a reconstruction of the original latent space can help make predictions about which items come next. The structure of these reconstructing varies based on how much temporal discounting is employed when learning the sequence."></a>

				<p><a href="spikes.pdf" class="paperimg" target="_blank"><img src="spikes.PNG" width = "500px" align = 'center' alt="A schematic processing pipeline for iEEG data. The pipeline includes IED detection, artifcat rejection, and functional connectivity calulation with different measures and bands. Functional connectivity is then averaged into different groups and assessed for time windows with, and without IEDs"></a>

				<p><a href="netbci.pdf" class="paperimg" target="_blank"><img src="schematic_v1.png" width = "500px" align = 'center' alt="A schematic analysis pipeline. MEG data is segmented into 1s windows, and functional connectivity is calulated in each window. Each window is then pair with its correponding BCI performance measure. Non-negative matrix factorization is then used to decompose bothe brain connectivity and behavior into subgraphs with temporal expression. The method also gives each subgraph a quantitative association with behavior called the performance loading."></a>


				<p><a href="stim_control.pdf" class="paperimg" target="_blank"><img src="graphical_abstract.png" width = "400px" align = 'center' alt="A schematic of the network control theoretic model used to model stimulation. Data include network estimates of white matter connectivity and neural activity recordings from iEEG. The model them defines future brain activity (x(t+1)) as the current activity (x(t)) spread along white matter connections (A), and added to any external stimulation (Bu(t)). The formal model of activity is given as x(t+1) = Ax + Bu(t)."></a>
