	<p> <b>Learning in brain-computer interface control evidenced by joint decomposition of brain and behavior</b> <em> arXiv </em>, (2019).<a href="netbci.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have marked potential as a therapy to restore neural function, but their application is limited by the difficulty, and heterogeneity of learning to reliably control a BCI. Previous work has demonstrated that neural activity in diverse cognitive systems predicts learning across individuals, but is unclear how these different systems interact through time to cohesively support the volitional control of neural activity. In this manuscript, we employ non-negative matrix factorization to obtain a single, data-driven decomposition of brain and behavioral data taken during BCI learning. We identify separate groups of interacting brain areas that track performance and predict learning, and we characterize their spatial and temporal distributions. Lastly we use tools from network control theory to suggest a key role for networks that support learning in sustaining attention. </p>

	<p> <b>White matter network architecture guides direct electrical stimulation through optimal state transitions</b> <em> Cell Reports</em>, (2019).<a href="stim_control.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Optimizing direct electrical stimulation for the treatment of neurological disease remains diﬃcult due to an incomplete understanding of its physical propagation through brain tissue. Here, we use network control theory to predict how stimulation spreads through white matter to inﬂuence spatially distributed dynamics. We test the theorys predictions using a unique dataset comprised of diﬀusion weighted imaging and electrocorticography in epilepsy patients undergoing grid stimulation. We ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcance shared variance between the predicted activity state transitions and the observed activity state transitions. We then use an optimal control framework to posit testable hypotheses regarding which brain states and structural properties will eﬃciently improve memory encoding when stimulated. Our work quantiﬁes the role that white matter architecture plays in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation, and oﬀers empirical support for the utility of network control theory in explaining the brain’s response to stimulation.</p>

	<p> <b>Spatial embedding imposes constraints on neuronal network architectures</b> <em> Trends in Cognitive Science </em>, (2018). <a href="spatial_embedding.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Recent progress towards understanding circuit function has capitalized on tools from network science to parsimoniously describe the spatiotemporal architecture of neural systems. Such tools often address systems topology divorced from its physical instantiation. Nevertheless, for embedded systems such as the brain, physical laws directly constrain the processes of network growth, development, and function. We review here the rules imposed by the space and volume of the brain on the development of neuronal networks, and show that these rules give rise to a specific set of complex topologies. These rules also affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network dysfunction in disease. We close by discussing new tools and models to delineate the effects of spatial embedding.

	<p> <b>How do we understand other people?</b> <em> Fronteirs for Young Minds </em>, (2016). <a href="ffym.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Imagine this: you walk into class and see your friend sitting alone at a table. You notice your friend is looking downward, with a frown on her face. You would probably think from these clues that your friend is sad. But how did you know that? One way that your brain accomplishes this is by simulating or copying in your mind what you see the other person doing. This may help you understand that when you are frowning and looking downward, you are usually sad, so it is probably the case that your friend is sad too. While there are other hypotheses for how our brain understands others, we are going to focus on simulation. We will first examine neuroimaging experiments, in monkeys and in humans, in which we use technology to get an indication of brain activity. These brain activations help us understand simulation better. Lastly, we will discuss disorders such as autism, in which it may be more difficult to understand others’ actions, intentions, and emotions.
