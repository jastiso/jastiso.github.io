	<p> <b>Learning in brain-computer interface control evidenced by joint decomposition of brain and behavior</b> <em> arXiv </em>, (2019).<a href="netbci.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use an individuals ability to volitionally modulate localized brain activity, often as a therapy for motor dysfunction or to probe causal relations between brain activity and behavior. However, many individuals cannot learn to successfully modulate their brain activity, greatly limiting the eﬃcacy of BCI for therapy and for basic scientiﬁc inquiry. Formal experiments designed to probe the nature of BCI learning have oﬀered initial evidence that coherent activity across spatially distributed and functionally diverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully learn to control the BCI. However, little is known about how these distributed networks interact through time to support learning. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by constructing and applying a multimodal network approach to decipher brain-behavior relations in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface learning using magnetoencephalography. Speciﬁcally, we employ a minimally constrained matrix decomposition method – non-negative matrix factorization – to simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect their time-varying expression. We ﬁnd that learning is marked by diﬀuse brain-behavior relations: good learners displayed many subgraphs whose temporal expression tracked performance. Individuals also displayed marked variation in the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in regions important for sustaining attention. To test this model, we use tools that stipulate regional dynamics on a networked system (network control theory), and ﬁnd that good learners display a single subgraph whose temporal expression tracked performance and whose architecture supports easy modulation of brain regions important for attention. The nature of our contribution to the neuroscience of BCI learning is therefore both computational and theoretical; we ﬁrst use a minimally-constrained, individual speciﬁc method of identifying mesoscale structure in dynamic brain activity to show how global connectivity and interactions between distributed networks supports BCI learning, and then we use a formal network model of control to lend theoretical support to the hypothesis that these identiﬁed subgraphs are well suited to modulate attention. </p>

	<p> <b>White matter network architecture guides direct electrical stimulation through optimal state transitions</b> <em> Cell Reports</em>, (2019).<a href="stim_control.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Optimizing direct electrical stimulation for the treatment of neurological disease remains diﬃcult due to an incomplete understanding of its physical propagation through brain tissue. Here, we use network control theory to predict how stimulation spreads through white matter to inﬂuence spatially distributed dynamics. We test the theorys predictions using a unique dataset comprised of diﬀusion weighted imaging and electrocorticography in epilepsy patients undergoing grid stimulation. We ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcance shared variance between the predicted activity state transitions and the observed activity state transitions. We then use an optimal control framework to posit testable hypotheses regarding which brain states and structural properties will eﬃciently improve memory encoding when stimulated. Our work quantiﬁes the role that white matter architecture plays in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation, and oﬀers empirical support for the utility of network control theory in explaining the brain’s response to stimulation.</p>

	<p> <b>Spatial embedding imposes constraints on neuronal network architectures</b> <em> Trends in Cognitive Science </em>, (2018). <a href="spatial_embedding.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Recent progress towards understanding circuit function has capitalized on tools from network science to parsimoniously describe the spatiotemporal architecture of neural systems. Such tools often address systems topology divorced from its physical instantiation. Nevertheless, for embedded systems such as the brain, physical laws directly constrain the processes of network growth, development, and function. We review here the rules imposed by the space and volume of the brain on the development of neuronal networks, and show that these rules give rise to a specific set of complex topologies. These rules also affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network dysfunction in disease. We close by discussing new tools and models to delineate the effects of spatial embedding.

	<p> <b>How do we understand other people?</b> <em> Fronteirs for Young Minds </em>, (2016). <a href="ffym.pdf" class="paper" target="_blank">pdf</a> Imagine this: you walk into class and see your friend sitting alone at a table. You notice your friend is looking downward, with a frown on her face. You would probably think from these clues that your friend is sad. But how did you know that? One way that your brain accomplishes this is by simulating or copying in your mind what you see the other person doing. This may help you understand that when you are frowning and looking downward, you are usually sad, so it is probably the case that your friend is sad too. While there are other hypotheses for how our brain understands others, we are going to focus on simulation. We will first examine neuroimaging experiments, in monkeys and in humans, in which we use technology to get an indication of brain activity. These brain activations help us understand simulation better. Lastly, we will discuss disorders such as autism, in which it may be more difficult to understand others’ actions, intentions, and emotions.
